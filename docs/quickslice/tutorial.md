Tutorial: Build Statusphere with Quickslice
Let's build Statusphere, an app where users share their current status as an emoji. This is the same app from the AT Protocol docs, but using Quickslice as the AppView.

Along the way, we'll show what you'd write manually versus what Quickslice handles automatically.

Try it live: A working example is running at StackBlitz, connected to a slice at xyzstatusphere.slices.network with the xyz.statusphere.status lexicon.

NOTE: For the StackBliz example, OAuth will only work if you open the preview in a new tab and login from there 🫠.

#What We're Building
Statusphere lets users:

Log in with their AT Protocol identity
Set their status as an emoji
See a feed of everyone's statuses with profile information
By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how Quickslice eliminates the boilerplate of building an AppView.

#Step 1: Project Setup and Importing Lexicons
Every AT Protocol app starts with Lexicons. Here's the Lexicon for a status record:

{
"lexicon": 1,
"id": "xyz.statusphere.status",
"defs": {
"main": {
"type": "record",
"key": "tid",
"record": {
"type": "object",
"required": ["status", "createdAt"],
"properties": {
"status": {
"type": "string",
"minLength": 1,
"maxGraphemes": 1,
"maxLength": 32
},
"createdAt": { "type": "string", "format": "datetime" }
}
}
}
}
}
Importing this Lexicon into Quickslice triggers three automatic steps:

Jetstream registration: Quickslice tracks xyz.statusphere.status records from the network
Database schema: Quickslice creates a normalized table with proper columns and indexes
GraphQL types: Quickslice generates query, mutation, and subscription types
Without Quickslice With Quickslice
Write Jetstream connection code Import your Lexicon
Filter events for your collection xyz.statusphere.status
Validate incoming records
Design database schema Quickslice handles the rest.
Write ingestion logic
#Step 2: Querying Status Records
Query indexed records with GraphQL. Quickslice generates a query for each Lexicon type using Relay-style connections:

query GetStatuses {
xyzStatusphereStatus(
first: 20
sortBy: [{ field: createdAt, direction: DESC }]
) {
edges {
node {
uri
did
status
createdAt
}
}
}
}
The edges and nodes pattern comes from Relay, a GraphQL pagination specification. Each edge contains a node (the record) and a cursor for pagination.

You can filter with where clauses:

query RecentStatuses {
xyzStatusphereStatus(
first: 10
where: { status: { eq: "👍" } }
) {
edges {
node {
did
status
}
}
}
}
Without Quickslice With Quickslice
Design query API Query is auto-generated:
Write database queries
Handle pagination logic xyzStatusphereStatus { edges { node { status } } }
Build filtering and sorting
#Step 3: Joining Profile Data
Here Quickslice shines. Every status record has a did field identifying its author. In Bluesky, profile information lives in app.bsky.actor.profile records. Join directly from a status to its author's profile:

query StatusesWithProfiles {
xyzStatusphereStatus(first: 20) {
edges {
node {
status
createdAt
appBskyActorProfileByDid {
displayName
avatar { url }
}
}
}
}
}
The appBskyActorProfileByDid field is a DID join. It follows the did on the status record to find the profile authored by that identity.

Quickslice:

Collects DIDs from the status records
Batches them into a single database query (DataLoader pattern)
Joins profile data efficiently
Without Quickslice With Quickslice
Collect DIDs from status records Add join to your query:
Batch resolve DIDs to profiles
Handle N+1 query problem appBskyActorProfileByDid { displayName }
Write batching logic
Join data in API response
#Other Join Types
Quickslice also supports:

Forward joins: Follow a URI or strong ref to another record
Reverse joins: Find all records that reference a given record
See the Joins Guide for complete documentation.

#Step 4: Writing a Status (Mutations)
To set a user's status, call a mutation:

mutation CreateStatus($status: String!, $createdAt: DateTime!) {
createXyzStatusphereStatus(
input: { status: $status, createdAt: $createdAt }
) {
uri
status
createdAt
}
}
Quickslice:

Writes to the user's PDS: Creates the record in their personal data repository
Indexes optimistically: The record appears in queries immediately, before Jetstream confirmation
Handles OAuth: Uses the authenticated session to sign the write
Without Quickslice With Quickslice
Get OAuth session/agent Call the mutation:
Construct record with $type
Call putRecord XRPC on the PDS createXyzStatusphereStatus(input: { status: "👍" })
Optimistically update local DB
Handle errors
#Step 5: Authentication
Quickslice bridges AT Protocol OAuth. Your frontend initiates login; Quickslice manages the authorization flow:

User enters their handle (e.g., alice.bsky.social)
Your app redirects to Quickslice's OAuth endpoint
Quickslice redirects to the user's PDS for authorization
User approves the app
PDS redirects back to Quickslice with an auth code
Quickslice exchanges the code for tokens and establishes a session
For authenticated queries and mutations, include auth headers. The exact headers depend on your OAuth flow (DPoP or Bearer token). See the Authentication Guide for details.

#Step 6: Deploying to Railway
Deploy quickly with Railway:

Click the deploy button in the Quickstart Guide
Generate an OAuth signing key with goat key generate -t p256
Paste the key into the OAUTH_SIGNING_KEY environment variable
Generate a domain and redeploy
Create your admin account by logging in
Upload your Lexicons
See Deployment Guide for detailed instructions.

#What Quickslice Handled
Quickslice handled:

Jetstream connection: firehose connection, event filtering, reconnection
Record validation: schema checking against Lexicons
Database schema: tables, migrations, indexes
Query API: filtering, sorting, pagination endpoints
Batching: efficient related-record resolution
Optimistic updates: indexing before Jetstream confirmation
OAuth flow: token exchange, session management, DPoP proofs
Focus on your application logic; Quickslice handles infrastructure.
