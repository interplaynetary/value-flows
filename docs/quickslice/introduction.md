Quickslice
Warning This project is in early development. APIs may change without notice.

Quickslice is a quick way to spin up an AppView for AT Protocol applications. Import your Lexicon schemas and you get a GraphQL API with OAuth authentication, real-time sync from the network, and joins across record types without setting up a database or writing any backend code.

#The Problem
Building an AppView from scratch means writing a lot of infrastructure code:

Jetstream connection and event handling
Record ingestion and validation
Database schema design and normalization
XRPC API endpoints for querying and writing data
OAuth session management and PDS writes
Efficient batching when resolving related records
This adds up before you write any application logic.

#What Quickslice Does
Quickslice handles all of that automatically:

Connects to Jetstream and tracks the record types defined in your Lexicons
Indexes relevant records into a database (SQLite or Postgres)
Generates GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions from your Lexicon definitions
Handles OAuth and writes records back to the user's PDS
Enables joins by DID, URI, or strong reference, so you can query a status and its author's profile in one request
#When to Use It
You want to skip the AppView boilerplate
You want to prototype Lexicon data structures quickly
You want OAuth handled for you
You want to ship your AppView already
