Aggregations
Every record type has an aggregation query: {collectionName}Aggregated. For example, aggregate fm.teal.alpha.feed.play records with fmTealAlphaFeedPlayAggregated.

Aggregation queries are public; no authentication required.

#Basic Aggregation
Group by a field to count occurrences:

query {
fmTealAlphaFeedPlayAggregated(groupBy: [{ field: artists }]) {
artists
count
}
}
{
"data": {
"fmTealAlphaFeedPlayAggregated": [
{ "artists": [{ "artistName": "Radiohead" }], "count": 142 },
{ "artists": [{ "artistName": "Boards of Canada" }], "count": 87 }
]
}
}
#Filtering & Sorting
Use where to filter records, orderBy to sort by count, and limit to cap results.

Get a user's top 10 artists for 2025:

query {
fmTealAlphaFeedPlayAggregated(
groupBy: [{ field: artists }]
where: {
actorHandle: { eq: "baileytownsend.dev" }
playedTime: { gte: "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z", lt: "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z" }
}
orderBy: { count: DESC }
limit: 10
) {
artists
count
}
}
{
"data": {
"fmTealAlphaFeedPlayAggregated": [
{ "artists": [{ "artistName": "Radiohead" }], "count": 142 },
{ "artists": [{ "artistName": "Boards of Canada" }], "count": 87 }
]
}
}
#Multiple Fields
Group by multiple fields. Get top tracks with their artists:

query {
fmTealAlphaFeedPlayAggregated(
groupBy: [{ field: trackName }, { field: artists }]
where: {
actorHandle: { eq: "baileytownsend.dev" }
playedTime: { gte: "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z", lt: "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z" }
}
orderBy: { count: DESC }
limit: 10
) {
trackName
artists
count
}
}
{
"data": {
"fmTealAlphaFeedPlayAggregated": [
{ "trackName": "Everything In Its Right Place", "artists": [{ "artistName": "Radiohead" }], "count": 23 },
{ "trackName": "Roygbiv", "artists": [{ "artistName": "Boards of Canada" }], "count": 18 }
]
}
}
#Date Truncation
Group datetime fields by time intervals: HOUR, DAY, WEEK, or MONTH.

Get plays per month:

query {
fmTealAlphaFeedPlayAggregated(
groupBy: [{ field: playedTime, interval: MONTH }]
where: {
actorHandle: { eq: "baileytownsend.dev" }
playedTime: { gte: "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z", lt: "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z" }
}
orderBy: { count: DESC }
) {
playedTime
count
}
}
{
"data": {
"fmTealAlphaFeedPlayAggregated": [
{ "playedTime": "2025-03-01", "count": 847 },
{ "playedTime": "2025-01-01", "count": 623 },
{ "playedTime": "2025-02-01", "count": 598 }
]
}
}
